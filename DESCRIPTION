Description: Perform multi-processing temporal disaggregation of an annual to quarterly or monthly set of time series. Amongst the possible methods, the model-based proportional first difference (PFD) Denton is defined in State Space form. It offers the possibility to add outliers (level shift) in the Benchmark-to-Indicator (BI) ratio and import infra-annual BI ratio manually for some periods. The function also includes an automatic procedure to forecast the annual BI ratio and takes this forecast into account in the estimation of the out-of-sample periods. Instead of the automatic procedure, forecasts of the annual BI ratio can also be defined by the user.
